# Chrome-Music-Extension-Minecraft

A Chrome extension which plays Minecraft's music in the background while you browse. It's not finished yet, but it will eventually play the music randomly, to mimic the game.

## Acknowledgements

This project is heavily inspired by the [Animal Crossing Music Extension](https://github.com/JdotCarver/Animal-Crossing-Music-Extension). It may also have used some of their code.

The options page uses the [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) framework.
